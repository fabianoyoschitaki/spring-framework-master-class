What are the beans?
What are the dependencies of a bean?
Where to search for beans? => No need as SpringBootApplication scans package and subs

@Component (beans)
@Autowired (dependency)
@Primary (disambiguous component)

Older versions of Spring:
Setter Injection -> if dependency is optional
Constructor Injection -> if dependency is mandatory

You don't need a setter with the @Autowired, the value is set by reflection.

23 - Complex Scope Scenarios of a Spring Bean - Mix Prototype and Singleton
	if PersonDAO is singleton and has JdbcConnection is prototype as dependency, the same jdbcConnection object will be returned. 
	So you have to create a proxy
	@Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE, proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)

24 - Difference between Spring Singleton and GOF Singleton
	GOF - 1 instance per JVM, even if multiple applications are running in the same JVM, the same instance would be returned. 
	Spring - 1 instance per application context. If there are 5 application contexts in the same JVM, 5 different instances.
	
25 - Using Component Scan to scan for beans
	if you application is com.test, every sub package will be scanned for components.
	But if you have components say in com.abc, you have to add in the spring application:
	@ComponentScan("com.abc")
