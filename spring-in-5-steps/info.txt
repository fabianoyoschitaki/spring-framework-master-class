What are the beans?
What are the dependencies of a bean?
Where to search for beans? => No need as SpringBootApplication scans package and subs

@Component (beans)
@Autowired (dependency)
@Primary (disambiguous component)

Older versions of Spring:
Setter Injection -> if dependency is optional
Constructor Injection -> if dependency is mandatory

You don't need a setter with the @Autowired, the value is set by reflection.
