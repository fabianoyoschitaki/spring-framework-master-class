What are the beans?
What are the dependencies of a bean?
Where to search for beans? => No need as SpringBootApplication scans package and subs

@Component (beans)
@Autowired (dependency)
@Primary (disambiguous component)

Older versions of Spring:
Setter Injection -> if dependency is optional
Constructor Injection -> if dependency is mandatory

You don't need a setter with the @Autowired, the value is set by reflection.

23 - Complex Scope Scenarios of a Spring Bean - Mix Prototype and Singleton
	if PersonDAO is singleton and has JdbcConnection is prototype as dependency, the same jdbcConnection object will be returned. 
	So you have to create a proxy
	@Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE, proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)

24 - Difference between Spring Singleton and GOF Singleton
	GOF - 1 instance per JVM, even if multiple applications are running in the same JVM, the same instance would be returned. 
	Spring - 1 instance per application context. If there are 5 application contexts in the same JVM, 5 different instances.
